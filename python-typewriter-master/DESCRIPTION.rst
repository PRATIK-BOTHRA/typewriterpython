Python Typewriter is a very simple Python module that allows you to print out strings using a "typewriter" like effect. That is, each character is printed out individually with a brief pause in between characters.

This project was primarily made for use in chat bot interpreters, but can also be particularly useful for console based games and other similar applications.
